/**
 * Hard
 *
 * A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to print whitespaces and the array is printed as a string of digits s and all we know is that all integers in the array were in the range [1, k] and there are no leading zeros in the array.
 *
 * Given the string s and the integer k, return the number of the possible arrays that can be printed as s using the mentioned program. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "1000", k = 10000
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Explanation: The only possible array is [1000]
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "1000", k = 10
 *
 * Output: 0
 *
 * Explanation: There cannot be an array that was printed this way and has all integer >= 1 and <= 10.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "1317", k = 2000
 *
 * Output: 8
 *
 * Explanation: Possible arrays are [1317],[131,7],[13,17],[1,317],[13,1,7],[1,31,7],[1,3,17],[1,3,1,7]
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * s consists of only digits and does not contain leading zeros.
 * 1 <= k <= 10^9
